# Contributing

## Issues

* `good first issue` - can be picked up from just skimming through the code

* `intermediate` - need some knowledge of the working and purpose

* `hard` - usually big changes that require discussion with mentors

## Making a Pull Request

* To work on issue, ask the mentors to assign you the issue in the comments.

* Make sure that pull request is precise and does not contain any unncessary files or changes.

* Make sure you performed these checks( if applicable ) :

    * I have run `go fmt ./...`

    * I have run `go mod tidy` for all modules

    * I have followed **camelCase** and **PascalCase** correctly throughout my code

    * I have handled errors properly

* The pull request title should be descriptive and the concerned issue must be linked in the PR body (ex: fixes issue #10)
